# Surfs_Up
## Overview
  For this module,I analyzed a dataset to determine if opening Surf n' Shake in Hawaii is a good idea. My investor ,W.avy, had concerns of this business due to a similiar investment that failed due to the weather conditions in the area. I have been tasked to analyze the weather conditions in Oahu to determine if weather would be a factor in opening Surf n' Shake.
## Results
I started with analyzing the yearly data from data supplied by W. Avy. Knowing where to start is hard to see, so I used August 23, 2017 because that is the date that W. Avy first went surfing. An ideal precipitation is one that will allow the area around the location to stay green, while also avoiding a lot of rain that would cause customers to not want to surf and get ice cream. The bar chart below gives us a rough estimate of the weather conditions of the area around the potential location.

  Although this chart can be used to see general trends, we can get more information by considering other factors like maximum, minimum, and average precipitation percentage.

  Looking at the more detailed table, we can see that the average precipitation percentage falls around 18% which is an ideal percentage for good climate year round.
  To look at temperature, I decided to locate the one station with the most data to narrow down the amount of data. Below are the results in a bar chart. This chart shows temperature in fahrenheit at the bottom with the frequency of that temperature on the y-axis.

  In order to gather more specific data in regaurds to temperature, I decided to focus on the months of June and December since these months are in opposing months. Using a month in summer and winter should show the biggest temperature differences.

 ![dec_temps](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Challange%20Images/December_temps.png)
 
  Usign these charts, we can see:
  * Both months have an average temperature around 70 degrees, varying within 3 degrees
  * The minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees cooler in December, but the maximum stays in the mid 80's for both
  * Although the two months are in opposite seasons, the weather stays relatively consistent
## Summary
  Since temperature and precipitation seem consistent throughout the year, it is safe to say that weather will not prove to be an issue for Surf n' Shake. I've decided to analyze this further and look into the precipitation for June and December.

 ![dec_precip](https://github.com/JTGonzaga/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Challange%20Images/Dec_precip.png)
 
 Looking at the differences in precipitaiton, we can see that the average precipitation for December is higher at 21% vs around 14% in June. This is to be expected because of the change in season, but due to the consistency of temperature I assume that it does not have a huge effect on climate.
